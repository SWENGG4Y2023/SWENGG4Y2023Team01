# The C4 model for visualising software architecture
The C4 model is a visual modeling approach used to describe and communicate the architecture of software systems. It provides a set of hierarchical diagrams that help stakeholders understand the structure, components, and interactions of a system.

## System Context Diagram 
This diagram provides an overview of the system being modeled and its relationships with external entities, such as users, systems, or devices. It shows the system as a single box and its external dependencies.

## Container Diagram
The container diagram zooms in on the system to show the high-level software architecture. It depicts the major containers or components of the system, such as web servers, databases, mobile apps, or microservices, and their interactions. Each container typically represents a separately deployable and scalable unit.
