# **Netflix Software Testing Document**

## **1. Introduction:**

-   Purpose: This document provides an overview of the software testing process for Netflix, a popular streaming platform.
-   Scope: The testing activities covered in this document include functional,    
performance, security, and compatibility testing.
- Audience: This document is intended for the testing team and other stakeholders involved in the software testing process.



## **2. Testing Objectives:**
   - Ensure the functionality of all Netflix features, including browsing, searching, streaming, and user account management.
   - Validate the performance of the streaming service under different network conditions and user load.
   - Identify and address potential security vulnerabilities to protect user data and ensure a secure streaming experience.
   - Test the compatibility of Netflix across different devices, operating systems, and web browsers.


# **3. Testing Process:**
   - Test Planning:
   - Define test objectives, test scenarios, and test cases.
      - Identify test environments, test data requirements, and testing tools.
   - Test Design:
      - Create detailed test cases covering different features and user interactions.
      - Develop test data and identify the expected results for each test case.
   - Test Execution:
      - Execute test cases based on priority and test schedules.
      - Document test results, including any deviations or defects found.
      - Report defects using a standardized defect tracking system.
   - Test Analysis and Reporting:
      - Analyze test results and identify trends or recurring issues.
      - Generate test reports highlighting the overall quality and any areas for improvement.



# **4. Testing Types:**
## Unit Testing:
- Unit testing is a technique for evaluating the suitability of individual units of source code.
- It can be applied to groups of one or more program modules, along with related control data, use guidelines, and operating procedures.
- Units can be considered as the smallest tested components of an application, such as functions in procedural programming or methods in object-oriented programming.
- Unit tests are created by programmers or white box testers as part of the development process.
- Each test case is independent of the others, aiding in module isolation testing.
- Techniques like method stubs and fake objects may be used to facilitate unit testing.
- The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that the code adheres to design specifications and operates as expected.
- Unit tests can be implemented as part of build automation or executed manually by software engineers.
   
## Integration Testing:
- Integration testing is a stage of software testing that involves combining and testing many software modules together.
- It comes before validation testing and is done after unit testing.
- The modules that have already passed unit testing serve as the input for integration testing.
- Grouping these modules into more substantial aggregates is a component of integration testing.
- These aggregates are subjected to the tests specified in an integration test plan.
- An integrated system that is prepared for system testing is the result of integration testing.
   
## Program Test
- After coding and compilation, the programs need to undergo independent testing with prepared test data.
- During this testing phase, any unexpected occurrences or issues should be identified and noted.
- The identified issues should then be debugged and resolved.

## Functional Testing:
- Verify the functionality of Netflix features, such as user authentication, content playback, and recommendation algorithms.
- Test different user roles (subscriber, administrator, content creator) and their respective permissions.
- Validate the integration of third-party services, such as payment gateways and content delivery networks.
   
## System Test:
- Once the program tests for each system program are written and errors are resolved, the system test is considered complete.
- The system test involves testing the entire system with actual data.
- During the execution of the system, the output is carefully analyzed at each stage.
- If the observed outputs do not match the expected outputs, bugs or errors in specific programs are identified, fixed, and reverified.
- When it is confirmed that the system is running without any errors, users are invited to test the system with their real data.
- This allows the system to be presented to users, demonstrating that it operates according to their requirements.

## Performance Testing:
- Measure the streaming performance under various network conditions (low bandwidth, high latency) and user loads.
- Conduct load testing to determine the system's capacity and scalability.
- Monitor resource utilization, response times, and throughput during peak usage periods.

## Security Testing:
- Identify and assess potential vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.
- Validate the effectiveness of security controls, including encryption, access controls, and data privacy measures.
- Perform penetration testing to simulate attacks and evaluate the system's resistance to unauthorized access.

## Compatibility Testing:
- Test Netflix on different devices (smart TVs, smartphones, tablets), operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows), and web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Validate the compatibility of Netflix with different screen resolutions, aspect ratios, and input methods.
